# About Me
Welcome to my site! Thanks for checking it out. I'm a a software developer and student in the Bachelor of Computer Science program at [UBC](https://ubc.ca). Prior to starting at UBC, I studied medicine at [Queen's](https://queensu.ca) before switching tracks to become a software developer.

When I'm not at school, I work at a Vancouver-area startup called [Bears Blooms](https://bearsblooms.com), predominantly on backend API development. If you or someone you know in the Vancouver or Victoria area want to get some flowers delivered, check us out!

I also enjoy experimenting and learning new technologies. I'm currently interested in [Go](https://golang.org), which has been a ton of fun to learn. Check out my first blog post [here](/post/backtracking/) where I talk about building an N-queens solver in Go.

My latest personal project has been focused on learning about Docker and Kubernetes, and how they can lower the barrier to entry for building reliable distributed systems. If you want to check out some of my work, you can find it on [Github](https://github.com/adammitha).
